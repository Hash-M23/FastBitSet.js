# FastBitSet.js : a speed-optimized BitSet implementation

A BitSet  (also called Bitmap or bit vector) is an ideal data structure to implement a
set when values being stored are reasonably small integers. It can be orders of magnitude
faster than a generic set implementation. Moreover, a BitSet has fast support for set
operations (union, difference, intersection).

The FastBitSet.js implementation optimizes for speed, leveraging commonly available features
like typed arrays. It can be several times faster than competitive alternatives. It should be supported by most of the modern browsers and JavaScript
engines.  It is ideal for maintaining sets of integers when performance matters.

Usage
===

```javascript
var b = new FastBitSet();// initially empty
         // will throw exception if typed arrays are not supported
b.set(1);// add the value "1"
b.has(1); // check that the value is present! (will return true)
b.add(2);
console.log(""+b);// should display {1,2}
b.add(10);
b.array(); // would return [1,2,10]
var c = new FastBitSet([1,2,3,10]); // create bitset initialized with values 1,2,3,10
c.difference(b); // from c, remove elements that are in b
var su = c.union_size(b);// compute the size of the union (bitsets are unchanged)
c.union(b); // c will contain all elements that are in c and b
var out1 = c.new_union(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything in c and b 
var out2 = c.new_intersection(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything that is in both c and b 
var s1 = c.intersection_size(b);// compute the size of the intersection (bitsets are unchanged)
var s3 = c.difference_size(b);// compute the size of the difference (bitsets are unchanged)
ccc.intersection(b); // c will only contain elements that are in both c and b
c = b.clone(); // create a (deep) copy of b and assign it to c.
c.equals(b); // checks whether c and b are equal
```

If you are using node.js, you need to import the module:

```javascript
var FastBitSet = require("FastBitSet");
var b = new FastBitSet();// initially empty
         // will throw exception if typed arrays are not supported
b.set(1);// add the value "1"
```
npm install
===

      $ npm install fastbitset

Testing
===

Using node.js, you can test the code as follows...

      $ nodejs unit/basictests.js



Is it faster?

It can be quite fast compared to competitive alternatives :
